Web App Template
================
## We can at least start from a sane place

The scaffolding tools have become unusable, chasing after every fad, with the attention span of a chipmunk.

I decided to put together my own starting point for simple, usually disposable, web apps.

**Uses:**
 - BrowserSync
 - EJS
 - esbuild
 - Express
 - Karma
 - Mocha
 - Morgan
 - Node
 - Winston

## Repo Layout
 - `app/`	- main application code
 - `dist/`	- application build, generated by `npm run build` and used as source for container builds
 - `nginx/`	- front-end container, reverse proxy, WAF
 - `test/`	- run tests with `npm test`
 - `tools/`	- build, serve, etc tools
